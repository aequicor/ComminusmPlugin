Communicate with the user in Russian (ru). All prose — questions, explanations, status updates, summaries, and reasoning addressed to the user — must be in Russian. Keep code, file paths, shell commands, identifiers, manifest keys, error codes, and other technical tokens verbatim in their original form.

## Memory (KnowledgeOS)

Long-term memory is in a KnowledgeOS vault accessed via MCP. Prefer these
over filesystem grep when you need context outside the current task:

- `search_docs(query, filters?)` — semantic + BM25 search. Filter shape:
  `{"fm.<key>": "<value>"}`. Use first when context is missing.
- `get_doc(path)` — fetch one document by vault-relative path.
- `list_docs(directory?)` — enumerate documents under a vault directory.
- `write_doc(path, content, frontmatter?)` — create. Use `[[other-doc]]`
  wikilinks for cross-refs (auto-loaded on retrieval). Frontmatter keys
  become `fm.<key>` filters.
- `update_doc(path, content, preserve_frontmatter?)` — modify existing.
  Pass `preserve_frontmatter: true` for body-only edits.

Logical key → frontmatter filter (matches manifest layout):
- feature → `{"fm.type": "domain", "fm.scope": "feature"}`
- subsystem → `{"fm.type": "reference", "fm.scope": "subsystem"}`
- decision → `{"fm.type": "decision"}`
- tech-debt → `{"fm.type": "tech-debt"}`
- documentation → `{"fm.type": "documentation"}`

If an MCP call errors or the server is unreachable, fall back to Read/Grep
on `vault/specs/`. Do not block the task on a memory failure — log it and
proceed.

## Memory (filesystem)

Long-term memory is plain markdown at `vault/specs/`:
- features → `vault/specs/features/<module>/<feature>/spec.md`
- subsystems → `vault/specs/subsystems/<name>.md`
- decisions → `vault/specs/DECISIONS.md`
- tech-debt → `vault/specs/tech-debt/<module>/<slug>.md`
- documentation → `vault/specs/guidelines/<module>/<topic>.md`

Read with Read/Grep. Write with the host's edit/write tools. KnowledgeOS
is not enabled — there is no semantic search, no wikilink expansion, no
reranking. List the vault before claiming a document is missing.

<workflow>
Add an extra agent, command, skill, dialect, or target adapter package to this installed kit. Argument: $URL_OR_PATH (URL to a YAML/MD package or local path). The command fetches/copies the package, validates against the relevant schema, registers it in the manifest (with user confirmation), and re-runs `kit-setup generate`.

You are extending an installed ai-agent-kit with one additional package. Argument: $URL_OR_PATH.

## Step 1 — Resolve source

1. If $URL_OR_PATH starts with `http(s)://`:
   - Normalize `github.com/.../blob/...` → `raw.githubusercontent.com/...`.
   - Fetch the resource. If it's a directory listing (e.g. github tree URL) — STOP, ask user for a single file URL.
2. Otherwise treat as a local path. Verify exists.

## Step 2 — Determine package kind

3. Inspect the file:
   - YAML with `_profile_name` / `_profile_description` and a `tools[]` / `agents[]` block → **manifest profile** (deep-merge into manifest).
   - YAML at `dialect.yaml` shape → **prompt dialect** package.
   - YAML at `adapter.yaml` shape → **target adapter** package.
   - Markdown at `prompts/<Agent>.md` shape → **agent prompt** body.
   - Markdown at `commands/<name>.md` → **slash command**.
   - Directory containing `SKILL.md` → **skill**.

## Step 3 — Validate

4. Schema-validate against the relevant schema in `.aikit/schema/`.
5. For external sources, print the parsed package and ask for explicit confirmation before registering.

## Step 4 — Register

6. Copy/place files into the appropriate templates directory under the project's kit-setup templates root (or extend by reference if the package lives outside).
7. Update `.aikit/manifest.yaml`:
   - **dialect** → append to `prompt_dialects[]` with `path` pointing at the package.
   - **adapter** → append to `target_adapters[]`.
   - **agent** → append to `agents[]` with prompt include path.
   - **command/skill** → no manifest update needed; the binary auto-discovers.

8. Show a manifest diff and wait for user confirmation before writing.

## Step 5 — Re-render

9. Run `kit-setup verify .aikit/manifest.yaml`. If it errors → revert and STOP.
10. Run `kit-setup generate .aikit/manifest.yaml`.

## Step 6 — Report

11. Output summary:
    - Package registered (kind, id).
    - Files written by re-generation.
    - Next steps: `git diff`, review, commit.

## Safety rules

- **External packages need user confirmation.** A package fetched from outside the kit's own repo cannot be added silently.
- **Cardinality replacement needs user confirmation.** Adding a `language` profile when one is already present asks "Replace `<old>` with `<new>`?" and stops on no.
- **Manifest write needs user confirmation.** A unified diff is shown before the manifest is overwritten.
- **Never modify files outside the project root.**
- **Never touch user-authored content** in `vault/specs/`.
- **If any rendered host config file** (e.g. `.claude/settings.json`, `opencode.json`) **ends up with a literal API key** → STOP and warn user.
